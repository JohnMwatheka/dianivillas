                                      As one of the most iconic tourist attractions in Diani, the Kongo Mosque is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the city. This mosque was built by Arab traders back in the 14th century and is the oldest mosque in East Africa. One of the most surprising facts about this mosque, however, is that Muslims still gather there on a regular basis for prayers. The mosque is surrounded by a beautiful garden that is filled with big baobab trees, some of which were planted by Arabs. The Kongo River and the Indian Ocean can be seen while you are outside the mosque. Having such a picturesque view in Diani Kenya makes it an excellent place to enjoy your vacation.

                                      Flying To and From Diani Beach: The beautiful palm-fringed stretch of white sandy beaches in Diani is a sight to behold – especially while soaking up the views from the sky.  Stretching almost 20km from the Kongo river to the north and <strong>Galu beach</strong> to the south, Diani beach is considered to be the best beach destination in Africa. If your next holiday destination is Diani and you are wondering how to get there, the most convenient &amp; fastest way would be to fly directly to Diani. If you do opt to fly, then you have two options either flying from Nairobi’s Wilson airport or Jomo Kenyatta International Aiport or from Moi International Airport in Mombasa. Wilson airport is located 10 km from Kenya’s capital, Nairobi while Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is only 17km. If you’re coming to Kenya for the first time, JKIA will most likely be your entry point to Kenya and therefore it would be easier to connect a flight directly to Diani from there Several local airlines operate flights to Diani Beach at Wilson airport and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and therefore you can arrive and book the next flight at your convenience. The flight from Nairobi to Ukunda airstrip takes approximately 45 minutes. On the other hand, if you book your flight from Moi International airport to Diani Beach it will take less than 15 minutes to touch down at Ukunda airstrip from where you can transfer to your Hotel.

                          <strong>Diani beach</strong> has the quintessential <strong>holiday climate</strong>. It has fantastic weather throughout the year. December to April is generally the hottest time of year with an average temperature of 31 °C. In July and August the temperature generally averages 27 °C. One thing that can affect your beach experience is the monsoon winds. April and May are the wettest months due to the monsoon rains. February is usually the driest month and March the hottest. The south coast of Kenya, on the south coast of the country, is pursuing seasonality and offers a destination that can be enjoyed all year long. Rainfall in tropical areas usually begins in the afternoon and can even occur at night. It is, however, advised that the <strong>best time to visit Diani in Kenya</strong> is in July-September, when it is slightly cooler. January-March are also good months because the weather is not as hot as during the rest of the year.

                          <br>
                          Please take care with the sun it is much stronger than you think even on a cloudy day! At all times sunscreen should be used. It is recommended that a minimum sunscreen Factor 15 be applied at sea level. Spending a long time in the sun leads to dehydration and sunstroke, take special care when you are on boats as the sea reflection intensifies the sunburn factor. Please be sure to drink plenty of liquid during the day (beer doesn't help!).

                          Diani Beach is a safe place. However common sense should be applied at all times. Remember you are in a third world country and «poverty does exist», as such be aware of petty thieves. DO NOT stroll on the beach or on the road at night (especially with your Rolex Watch and camera). If you have nothing to steal on you, nobody can steal from you!

                        There are many <strong>Diani Beach Boys</strong> who operate on the Diani Beach and some clients do experience harassment. The best way to deal with them–if you have the patience–is to ignore them. However, some of them can be very persistent, please ask them politely to leave you alone and if you have any major problems, please report to the Office Manager who will report them to the Diani police. Beach hawking and harassment of tourists is illegal in Kenya and Diani Marine does not condone their activities on the beach. Please do not book any safaris or tours or excursions with beach boys, Diani Marine will not accept any responsibility for deals gone wrong with beach boys/local dealers.
